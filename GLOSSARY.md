# MUMPS

A parallel sparse direct solvers which provides
 - Solution of large linear systems with 
   - symmetric positive definite matrices 
   - general symmetric matrices 
   - general unsymmetric matrices
 - Version for complex arithmetic
 - Parallel factorization and solve phases 
   (uniprocessor version also available)
 - Iterative refinement and backward error analysis
 - Various matrix input formats 
   assembled, distributed, elemental format 
 - Partial factorization and Schur complement matrix (centralized or 2D block-cyclic)
 - Interfaces to MUMPS: Fortran, C, Matlab and Scilab
 - Several reorderings interfaced: AMD, QMAD, AMF, PORD, METIS, PARMETIS, SCOTCH, PT-SCOTCH

# rank
MPI local rank of a data structure

# globalRank
MPI global rank of a data structure

# marker
Marker for mesh element, faces, edges or point. Element marker are often associated to material properties

# marker2
Marker for mesh element, faces, edges or point. It is used for example to iterate over element thanks to a particular piecewise constant field

# marker3
Marker for mesh element, faces, edges or point. It is used for example to iterate over element thanks to a particular piecewise constant field

# elements

free-function to apply to a mesh to retrieve the iterators over the elements of the mesh stored on the current processor

# markedelements

free-function to apply to a mesh to retrieve the iterators over marked elements (by a string or an integer id) of the mesh stored on the current processor

# marked2elements

free-function to apply to a mesh to retrieve the iterators over marked elements (by a string or an integer id) with marker2 of the mesh stored on the current processor

# marked3elements

free-function to apply to a mesh to retrieve the iterators over marked elements (by a string or an integer id) with marker3 of the mesh stored on the current processor

# boundaryelements

free-function to apply to a mesh to retrieve the iterators over  elements touching the boundary of the mesh stored on the current processor with an face, edge or point.

# internalelements

free-function to apply to a mesh to retrieve the iterators over  elements which are not touching with a point, edge or face the boundary of the mesh stored on the current processor

# edges

free-function to apply to a mesh to retrieve the iterators over the edges of the mesh stored on the current processor

# markededges

free-function to apply to a mesh to retrieve the iterators over marked edges (by a string or an integer id) of the mesh stored on the current processor

free-function to apply to a mesh to retrieve the iterators over marked faces (by a string or an integer id) of the mesh stored on the current processor

# boundaryfaces

Free-function to apply to a mesh to retrieve the iterators over boundary faces of the mesh stored on the current processor.

# integrate

Free-function to define integral expressions entering the definition of integrals, linear and bi-linear forms.

# project

Free-function to project an expression $$e$$ over a nodal function space $$X_h$$. It would typically return the interpolant $$\Pi_h e \in X_h$$ of the expression in the function space.

# mean

Free-function to compute the average value of a function.

# normL2

Free-function to compute the $$L^2$$ norm of an expression

# normH1
