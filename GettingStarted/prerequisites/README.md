**Here** we focus on the basic tools needed to implement feel++. To  clearly understand each tool,we will make reference to a simple dummy mini project, operation. This  is  simple program of basic arithmetic operations built with the aid of all these basic tools to help easily understand the role of each of them.The program consists of three files named below :   
  1. [main.cpp](https://github.com/wkyoshe/stageM1/blob/master/src/main.cpp)
  2. [operation.cpp](https://github.com/wkyoshe/stageM1/blob/master/src/operation.cpp)
  3. [operation.h](https://github.com/wkyoshe/stageM1/blob/master/src/operation.h)
  
Now, below is a detailed description of each tool and how it's used in documenting our simple dummy project.This basically sets tone for any documentation of any project , feel++ included.

Here is the list of basic tools we need for Feel++ : 
* [Makefile](makefile.md)
* [CMake](cmake.md)
* [GitHub](github.md)
* [Doxygen](doxygen.md)
