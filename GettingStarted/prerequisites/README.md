Here we focus on the basic tools needed to implement feel++. To  clearly understand each tool, we will make reference to a simple dummy mini project, operation. This  is  simple program of basic arithmetic operations built with the aid of all these basic tools to help easily understand the role of each of them. The program consists of three files named below : 
--->
In order to use Feel++, a set of tools are required.
In the following, we will briefly present them *via* a simple project that performs basic arithmetic operations.   
****The project files are :****
  1. main.cpp
  2. operation.cpp
  3. operation.h   

We will present 
- how to compile the program using a [MakeFile](makefile.md)
- how to make it simpler with [CMake](cmake.md)
- what is git and [GitHub](github.md)
- How the code can be [documented](doxygen.md)
