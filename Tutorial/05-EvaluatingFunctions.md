Evaluating function 
==================

Once you  have created an element, you may want to give it a value, that can depends on a lot of parameters (mainly spaces, but others may apply).

To do so, Feel++ relies on expressions.
We may use various kind of expressions :

<!-- toc -->


# Built-in 

Instead of defining an expression from a string, you can use

!CODEFILE "code/05-myexporter.cpp"

The list of the Feel++ Keyword is [here](../QuickReference/keywords.md).

# Hard Coded 

One other method to define function is described here.

!CODEFILE "code/myfunctor.cpp"
