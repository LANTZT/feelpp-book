Using function {#TutorialFunctions}
=====================

Once you  have created an element, you may want to give it a value, that can depends on a lot of parameters (mainly spaces, but others may apply).

To do so, Feel++ relies on expression.
We may use tree kind of expression :

- [Build-in](#build)
- [Hard coded](#hc)


# Built-in {#build}

Instead of defining an expression from a string, you can use

!CODEFILE "code/05-myexporter.cpp"

The list of the Feel++ Keyword is [here](../QuickReference/keywords.md).

# Hard Coded {#hc}

One other method to define function is described here.

!CODEFILE "code/myfunctor.cpp"
