toc::[]

Once you  have created an element, you may want to give it a value, that can depends on a lot of parameters (mainly spaces, but others may apply).

To do so, Feel++ relies on expressions.
We may use various kind of expressions :

== Built-in 

Instead of defining an expression from a string, you can use

[source,c++]
----
{% include "code/05-myexporter.cpp" %}
----

The list of the Feel++ Keyword is link:../QuickReference/keywords.adoc[here].

== Hard Coded 

One other method to define function is described here.

[source,c++]
----
{% include "code/myfunctor.cpp" %}
----
