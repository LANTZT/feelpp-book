# Introduction

We now turn to the next crucial mathematical ingredient: the function
space, whose definition depends on $$\Omega_h$$ - or more precisely
its partitioning $$\mathcal{T}_h$$ - and the choice of basis
function. Function spaces in Feel++ follow the same definition and
Feel++ provides support for continuous and discontinuous Galerkin
methods and in particular approximations in $$L^2$$, $$H^1$$-conforming and $$H^1$$-nonconforming, $$H^2$$, $$H(\mathrm{div})$$ and $$H(\mathrm{curl})$$[^1].
