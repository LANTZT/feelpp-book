# Algebra Backends {#backends}

Non-/Linear algebra backends are crucial components of Feel++. They provide a uniform interface between Feel++ data structures and underlying the linear algebra libraries used by Feel++.

## Libraries 

Feel++ interfaces the following libraries:
 - PETSc : Portable, Extensible Toolkit for
Scientific Computation
 - SLEPc : Eigen value solver framework based on PETSc
 - Eigen3
