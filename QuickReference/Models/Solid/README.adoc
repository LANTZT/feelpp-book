== Properties

* Linear 
* SaintVenant Kirchhoff
* NeoHookean

When materials are closed to incompressibility formulation in displacement/pressure are available.

The fields allowed to be exported in the `Fields` section are:

- displacement
- velocity
- acceleration
- stress or normal-stress
- pressure
- material-properties
- pid
- fsi
- Von-Mises
- Tresca
- principal-stresses
- all

.Measure type and range type associated
|===
|Measure type | Range type | example

|Points | coords | "{0,0,0}"
|Maximum | markers | "marker1"
|Minimum | markers | "marker1"
|volume_variation* | - | "volume_variation":""
|===

*volume_variation does not take a set of point or of range, it is a volumic measure.

The fields on which one can do measures:

- volume_variation
- displacement
- velocity
- acceleration
- pressure
- principal-stress-0
- principal-stress-1
- principal-stress-2
- sigma_xx, sigma_xy, ...
