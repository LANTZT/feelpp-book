Integration
===========

You should be able to create a mesh now. If it is not the case, get back to the section [Mesh](mesh.md).

The prerequisite of this section is to be able to .
* [Iterate over a region of a mesh elements, faces, edges and points](Mesh/iterators.md)
* [Define expressions](keywords.md)

Then you can define and compute integrals
* [Define integration domain](Mesh/iterators.md)
* [Compute integrals](Integrals/integrate.md)
* [Compute mean value of a function](Integrals/mean.md)
* [Compute norms](Integrals/norms.md)
