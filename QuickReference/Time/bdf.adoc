= Backward Differentiation Formula

The backward differentiation formula, also abriged BDF, is a set of implict methods used with ordinary differential equation ( ODE ) for numerical integration. For example, the initial value problem :

$$ y' = f(t,y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0. $$

can be solved with BDF.

For a given time and function, these methods try to approximate the derivative of this functions, using old computed times data.

The methods, components of BDF, are split by their order value. We have then BDF1, BDF2,..., and so on.
