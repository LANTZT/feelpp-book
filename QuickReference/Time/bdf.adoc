= Backward Differentiation Formula

The backward differentiation formula, also abriged BDF, is a set of implict methods used with ordinary differential equation ( ODE ) for numerical integration. For example, the initial value problem :

$$
y' = f(t,y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0.
$$

can be solved with BDF.

For a given time and function, these methods try to approximate the derivative of this functions, using old computed times data.

The methods, components of BDF, are split by their order value. We have then BDF1, BDF2,..., and so on.The general formula can be written as

$$
\sum_{k=0}^s a_k y_{n+k} = h \beta f(t_{n+s}, y_{n+s}) 
$$where s is the order, $$h$$ is the step size and $$t_n = t_0 + nh$$. $$a_k$$ and $$\beta$$ are dependent from order $$s$$, and can be easily found into literature. Here is the two first formula :

$$BDF1:  y_{n+1} - y_n = h f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$$
( This is the backward Euler method )

$$BDF2:  y_{n+2} - \tfrac43 y_{n+1} + \tfrac13 y_n = \tfrac23 h f(t_{n+2}, y_{n+2})$$
