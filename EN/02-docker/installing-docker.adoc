Installing Docker
=================

This section covers briefly the installation of Docker. It should be a relatively simple smooth process to install Docker. 

=== Channels

Docker offers two channels: the stable and beta channels. 

The _stable channel_ is fully baked and tested software providing a reliable platform to work with. Releases are not frequent.

The _beta channel_ offer cutting edge features and experimental versions of the Docker Engine. This is a continuation of the initial Beta program of Docker to experiment with the latest features in development. It incurs far more instabilities than the stable channel but releases are done frequently -- possibly several releases per month.

In the latter we shall consider only installing and using the _stable channel_.
