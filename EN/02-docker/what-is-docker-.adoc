What is Docker ?
================

Container based technologies are revolutionizing 
development, deployment and execution of software.
Containers encapsulate a software and allow to run 
seamlessly on different platforms -- clusters, workstations, laptops. -- The developer don't have to worry about specific environments and users spend less time on configuring and installing the software.
Container appear to be lightweight virtual machine(VM) -- they are started in a fraction of a second, -- but they, in fact, have important differences.

One of the difference is the isolation process. The VM share only the hypervisor, the OS and hardware whereas container may share between each other large parts  of filesystems rather than having copies. The figure below illustrates these fundamental differences

Docker is a container technology providing _(i)_ an engine to start and stop container, _(ii)_ a user friendly interface from the creation to the distribution of containers and _(iii)_ a hub thats provides publicly a huge number of container to download and avoid duplicating work.
