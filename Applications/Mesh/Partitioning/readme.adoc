# Partitioning

In `feelpp/applications/mesh`, an application, named `feelpp_mesh_partitioner`, can generate a hdf5 file from which a parallel mesh can be loaded.

## Options

The partitioner executable need some options in order to supply our result files.

* dim : the dimension of the mesh
- default : 3

* shape : the shape of the mesh elements 
- default : Simplex

* part : the number of partition we want

* ifile : name ( or path ) of the mesh 

Some options are also optionnal 

* odir : the output directory 

* ofile : the output file name

## Code 

The code will decompose a mesh, given by `ifile` option, into a number of partition equals to `part`. The result of this operation will then be export into two files, one in HDF5 format and the other as a json file. This last one is the one we given to Feel++ to retrieve the data.
