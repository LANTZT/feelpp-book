Feel++
======

Finite Element Embedded Library in C++
--------------------------------------



Feel++ is a unified C++ implementation of Galerkin methods (finite and
spectral element methods) in 1D, 2D And 3D to solve partial
differential equations.

Feel++ is
 - a versatile mathematical kernel solving easily problems using
   different techniques thus allowing testing and comparing methods,
   e.g. cG versus dG,
 - a *small* and *manageable* library which nevertheless encompasses a
   wide range of numerical methods and techniques and in particular
   reduced order methods such as the reduced basis method
 - a software that follows closely the mathematical abstractions
   associated with partial differential equations (PDE) and in
   particular the finite element mathematical framework and
   variational formulations
 - a library that offers solving strategies that scales up to
   thousands and even tens of thousands of cores (it is supported by a
   european Prace project currently )
 - a library entirely in ''C++'' allowing to create ''C++'' complex
   and typically non-linear multi-physics applications currently in
   industry, physics and health-care.
